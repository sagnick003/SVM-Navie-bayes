        "\n",
        "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It finds the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.\n",

        "Q2. What is the difference between Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "Hard Margin SVM assumes data is perfectly separable and does not allow misclassification, while Soft Margin SVM allows some misclassifications using a penalty parameter (C) to handle noisy or non-linear data.\n",

        "Q4. What is the role of Lagrange Multipliers in SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lagrange multipliers are used to convert the constrained optimization problem into its dual form, making it easier to solve. They help identify support vectors and enable the use of kernel functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are Support Vectors in SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "Support Vectors are the data points closest to the separating hyperplane. They define the position and orientation of the hyperplane, and removing them can change the decision boundary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What is a Support Vector Classifier (SVC)?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is the practical version of SVM that uses a soft margin to allow some misclassifications. It balances maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is a Support Vector Regressor (SVR)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Support Vector Regression (SVR) adapts SVM for regression by fitting a function within an epsilon margin. Only data points outside this margin become support vectors and affect the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is the Kernel Trick in SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Kernel Trick allows SVM to perform non-linear classification by mapping input data to a higher-dimensional space using kernel functions like linear, polynomial, or RBF, without explicit transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. Compare Linear Kernel, Polynomial Kernel, and RBF Kernel.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Kernel is best for linearly separable data, Polynomial Kernel handles moderate non-linearity, and RBF Kernel captures complex relationships but may overfit if not tuned properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What is the effect of the C parameter in SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "The C parameter controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors. A high C reduces errors but may overfit, while a low C increases margin but may underfit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is the role of the Gamma parameter in RBF Kernel SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "Gamma determines how far the influence of a training sample reaches. A high gamma means the model is more complex and may overfit, while a low gamma gives smoother, simpler boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is the Naïve Bayes classifier, and why is it called \"Naïve\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem. It is called “naïve” because it assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is Bayes’ Theorem?\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayes' Theorem is a powerful mathematical formula that is used to update the probability of a hypothesis ($A$) when new evidence ($B$) is introduced. It provides a way to logically revise an initial belief (the prior probability) based on observable data (the likelihood) to get a new, more accurate belief (the posterior probability).\n",
        "\n",
        "Formula and InterpretationThe formula for Bayes' Theorem is:$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Explain the differences between Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes.\n",
        "Gaussian NB handles continuous features, Multinomial NB is used for count data like word frequencies, and Bernoulli NB is used for binary features indicating presence or absence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. When should you use Gaussian Naïve Bayes over other variants?\n",
        "Gaussian Naïve Bayes should be used when features are continuous and follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution, such as in sensor or medical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the key assumptions made by Naïve Bayes?\n",
        "Naïve Bayes assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label and that each feature contributes equally to the outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Naïve Bayes?\n",
        "Advantages: Simple, fast, and effective with small or high-dimensional data.\n",
        "Disadvantages: Assumes feature independence and can perform poorly when features are correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. Why is Naïve Bayes a good choice for text classification?\n",
        "Naïve Bayes works well for text data because word occurrences are nearly independent, and it efficiently handles high-dimensional and sparse data like TF-IDF vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Compare SVM and Naïve Bayes for classification tasks.\n",
        "SVM is a discriminative model focusing on decision boundaries, while Naïve Bayes is a generative model based on probabilities. SVM is slower but more accurate; Naïve Bayes is faster but assumes independence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. How does Laplace Smoothing help in Naïve Bayes?\n",
        "Laplace Smoothing prevents zero probabilities for unseen features by adding one to feature counts. This ensures all probabilities remain non-zero and improves model robustness.\n",
